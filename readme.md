# Artillery

Node testing tool for load/performance/capacity.

Documentation is avaliable at [artillery website](https://artillery.io/docs/getting-started/)

## Installing 
First install artillery on your machine.

```bash
  npm install -g artillery 
```

## Configure
Create yml file where are test definitions and scenarios will be stored. See sample.yml for basic configuration.

Use [documentation for more info](https://artillery.io/docs/script-reference/)
to create configuration file.

## Run

To run a load test you can use comand prompt if you have artillery installed globally. If not you can use node commands to execute local version. I prefer local version.

- create command in package.json

```
npm run [command name]
```
